# Web-Prog-Assignment
A "simple" Archery Event Registration Page, implementing Event-Driven Responsive Web Design.

# What is this project?
This project was created for Web Programming Group Project `Semester 2 2022/2023`.

# How this project was built?
This project was built using `XAMPP Localhost`, together with `phpmyadmin MYSQLi` as database.

# What are inside this project?
There are 2 parts (_may change according to file mov.)_ :
- `Assets/...` : Containing the Core CSS, Js and other php files that is for backend-db
- `/___.php` : Page that is visible to user (all front-end)

### Now you could be asking, why in the bloddy hell did we use .php for front-end?
In the process of implementing stuff, we thought that it is more epic to have the `navbar` and `footer` separated
from the code. It would look more cleaner and readable; not to say much more easier to debug. (OOP concept goes brr)


# How do I run this project?
- Download the Zip of the entire repo
- Un-zip it inside `localhost/`
- !!! Import the database with test data using the `definately_not_injection.sql`
